(defn $cardinality
  "Takes a list of variables, and a frequency map (from numbers to
  frequencies), constrains that the frequency map is accurate. If
  the :closed flag is set to true, any keys that aren't in the
  frequency map can't appear at all in the list of variables.

  cardinality will generate vars in the model/compile phase

  Example: ($cardinality [:a :b :c :d :e] {1 :ones, 2 :twos})
